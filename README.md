# WebArticleAnalyzer
 his Jupyter Notebook automates the process of analyzing web articles by extracting text from URLs, preprocessing it, and computing various linguistic and readability metrics. It uses libraries like pandas, requests, BeautifulSoup, and nltk to scrape article content, clean the text by removing stopwords and special characters, and perform sentiment analysis using predefined positive and negative word lists. Additionally, it calculates readability scores such as the Fog Index, average sentence length, and the percentage of complex words, while also counting personal pronouns in the text. The results are compiled into a structured report and saved as an Excel file (Output.xlsx). This tool is useful for content analysis, SEO optimization, and academic research, providing insights into the tone, complexity, and readability of web articles. However, it could be improved with better error handling and more accurate complexity detection.
